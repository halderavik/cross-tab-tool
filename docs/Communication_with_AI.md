## Multiple-Response Analysis

**Example Prompts:**
- "Show me the distribution of all selected responses for the 'Which social media platforms do you use?' question"
- "Create a crosstab of all selected brands against age groups"
- "What percentage of respondents selected each combination of features?"

**Tips:**
- Specify if you want to see individual counts or percentages
- Mention if you want to compare against other variables
- Ask for specific combinations of responses

## Custom Variables & Recodes

**Example Prompts:**
- "Combine the 'Very Satisfied' and 'Satisfied' responses into a single 'Positive' category"
- "Create a new variable that groups ages into 'Young', 'Middle', and 'Senior'"
- "Recode the income brackets into three categories: Low, Medium, High"

**Tips:**
- Clearly specify the categories you want to combine
- Define the new category names
- Ask for verification of the recoding

## Subtotals & Net Rows

**Example Prompts:**
- "Add a 'Top 2 Box' row showing the sum of 'Very Satisfied' and 'Satisfied' responses"
- "Show me the net promoter score by region"
- "Calculate the total percentage for positive responses"

**Tips:**
- Specify which categories to include in the subtotal
- Define how you want the subtotal calculated
- Ask for percentage breakdowns if needed

## Advanced Statistical Tests

**Example Prompts:**
- "Compare the satisfaction scores between regions using t-tests"
- "Show me if there are significant differences in brand preference by age group"
- "Calculate the median income for each education level"

**Tips:**
- Specify the comparison groups
- Mention the type of test you want
- Ask for interpretation of the results

## Batch Table Generation

**Example Prompts:**
- "Create crosstabs for all demographic variables against satisfaction"
- "Generate tables for all brand metrics by region"
- "Show me all possible combinations of these three variables"

**Tips:**
- List the variables you want to analyze
- Specify any filters or conditions
- Ask for specific table formats

## Conditional Formatting

**Example Prompts:**
- "Highlight cells where the percentage is above 50%"
- "Show me a heatmap of the satisfaction scores"
- "Mark significant differences with an asterisk"

**Tips:**
- Specify the conditions for formatting
- Define the visual style you prefer
- Ask for explanation of the formatting

## Report Generation

**Example Prompts:**
- "Create a PowerPoint report with the key findings"
- "Export these tables to Excel with proper formatting"
- "Generate a PDF report with all the analysis"

**Tips:**
- Specify the format you want
- List the tables to include
- Define any specific styling requirements

## Multi-Step Analysis

**Example Prompts:**
- "First recode the satisfaction scale, then create a crosstab with age groups, and finally highlight significant differences"
- "Combine these categories, create a net score, and show me the regional breakdown"
- "Create a custom variable for brand loyalty, then analyze it by demographics"

**Tips:**
- Break down complex requests into steps
- Specify the order of operations
- Ask for intermediate results if needed

## Best Practices

   - Clearly state what you want to analyze
   - Specify the variables of interest
   - Define any conditions or filters

2. **Use Natural Language:**
   - Ask questions as you would to a human analyst
   - Provide context when needed
   - Don't hesitate to ask for clarification

3. **Request Verification:**
   - Ask the agent to confirm its understanding
   - Request explanation of the methodology
   - Ask for alternative approaches

4. **Iterative Analysis:**
   - Start with broad questions
   - Refine based on initial results
   - Ask follow-up questions

5. **Error Handling:**
   - If you get unexpected results, ask why
   - Request alternative approaches
   - Ask for troubleshooting help
